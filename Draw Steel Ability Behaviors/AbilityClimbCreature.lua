--Climbing other creatures (Draw Steel, "Climbing Other Creatures").
--
--A creature climbs another by getting into one of its SADDLES -- the same engine mechanism that
--seats a rider on a mount. A creature that has no saddles of its own (which is nearly all of them)
--gets an AD-HOC saddle created for the climber by CharacterToken.ClimbOntoCreature; it exists only
--while the climber is in it, on every client, and needs no cleanup.
--
--This one behavior covers both ends of the rule:
--  operation "climb"    -- the CASTER climbs each target. Used by the Climb Creature maneuver.
--  operation "dismount" -- each TARGET gets off whatever it is climbing. Used by the Hold On test
--                          the Shake Off maneuver forces its rider to make, where the rider is the
--                          caster and the target is itself.
--
--A dismount either drops the climber from the height of the saddle (dismountFalls, tier 1 of the
--Hold On test: "you fall off the creature ... taking falling damage and landing prone as usual" --
--the engine's own falling rules produce the damage and the prone condition) or climbs it down to
--the ground safely (tier 2: "you slide down the creature ... and don't land prone").
--
--Where the climber ends up depends on how the behavior is targeted, which is how the rule's "into
--an unoccupied adjacent space of your choice" is honoured for the fall without making the safe
--slide-down ask a question nobody cares about:
--  * On an ability whose targetType is EMPTYSPACE, the player has already been prompted for the
--    space and the CASTER lands in it (see the Fall Off Creature standard ability, which the Hold
--    On test invokes on a tier 1).
--  * Otherwise the nearest legal space is picked automatically, and the targets are the creatures
--    getting off (the tier 2 slide, or a DM shoving a rider off directly).
