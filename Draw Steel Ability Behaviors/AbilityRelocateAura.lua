--- @class ActivatedAbilityHurlGrabbedBehavior:ActivatedAbilityBehavior
--- Throws a creature the caster is grabbing down a line ability (Ogre Goon "People Bowling").
--- Runs with applyto = caster on a line-targeted ability, BEFORE its power roll:
---   1. picks the grabbed creature (prompting only if several pass hurlFilter),
---   2. ends the grab and teleports it to the last square of the line, or to the nearest
---      unoccupied square around that end (a prompt when there is more than one nearest square),
---   3. appends it to the cast's target list so the power roll that follows rolls against it too.
--- Lives in this file to reuse ChooseTransitDestination (the restrict-to-squares pick), which is
--- file-local. It is NOT forced movement: no stability, no collision, no distance reduction.
--- @field hurlFilter string GoblinScript on the grabbed creature; only creatures passing it can be hurled.
--- @field searchRadius number How far (squares) around the line's end to look for a free landing square.
--- @field addAsTarget boolean Append the hurled creature to the cast's targets for later behaviors.
--- @field promptText string Prompt shown when the director must choose between equally near squares.
