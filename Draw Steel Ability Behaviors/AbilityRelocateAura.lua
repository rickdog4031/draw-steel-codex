--- @field growEffect string Ongoing effect id applied to the caster before displacing ("" = none).
--- @field growEffectAlt string Applied instead of growEffect when growAltCondition is true.
--- @field growAltCondition string GoblinScript on the caster (cast symbols available).
--- @field growDuration string Duration id for the effect (default "eoe").

--- @field addAsTarget boolean Replace the cast's targets with the displaced creatures.
--- @field promptText string Prompt shown when several squares are equally near.
--- @field floatText string Label floated over each displaced creature ("" for none).
