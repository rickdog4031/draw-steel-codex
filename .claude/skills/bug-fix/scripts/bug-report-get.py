"""Fetch a single feedback report by id, from wherever it lives.

Checks /BugReports first (novel/unprocessed), then /BugReportsArchive (processed).
If the report has been triaged, also pulls its issue-registry node so the caller
gets the agent's analysis + Discord thread in one shot. The thread is the issue's
`threadId` field, absent when none was opened; `_threadId` is the registry KEY
(despite the name) and is not a thread id for issues since 2026-09-17.

Goes through /api/bugs/report on the internal-dashboards Worker, which holds the
Firebase service account server-side. This machine needs only the shared team
password -- no Firebase credential. See CREDENTIALS.md.

Usage:
  python bug-report-get.py <reportId>

Prints JSON:
