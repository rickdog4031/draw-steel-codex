"""Shared helpers for the bug-report triage pipeline.

All of the bug-report-*.py scripts import this. It centralises:
  - reaching the bug system through the internal-dashboards Worker (the
    supported path -- see "bug system API" below); this needs only the shared
    team password, and NO Firebase credential on this machine
  - loading bug-report-config.json (Discord webhooks, tag ids, dashboard url)
  - path resolution that works no matter what the current working directory is

HOW THE DATA IS REACHED. Reports live in the MCDM Realtime Database, but this
library does not talk to it. It calls /api/bugs/* on the internal-dashboards
Worker, which holds the service account as a Worker secret and exposes only the
bug system (one report by id, its issue node, its ticket marker, and a single
consent-gated chat write). The Worker enforces the consent gate itself, so it
cannot be skipped from here.

The service-account path (init_firebase/ref) is still present for the admin
tooling that shares this file, but nothing in the bug-fix skill calls it, and
firebase_admin is imported lazily so it need not even be installed.

Consumer-owned triage state lives under a single root in the MCDM RTDB:

  /BugReportTriage/issues/{issueId}    one node per distinct issue. The key is NOT
                                       a Discord thread id: since 2026-09-17 it is
                                       the opening report's short id (`4MVBGBUG`,
                                       `-2` on collision); before that it was the
                                       thread id. Ask the node -- see issue_thread().
      threadId   : the issue's Discord forum thread. Absent until somebody opens
                   one, which is ordinary, not an error. Backfilled on the older
                   thread-keyed issues, so this field answers for both eras.
      title      : short human title (also the forum post title)
      type       : bug | feature | feedback
      signature  : short stable dedupe key the agent assigns
      status     : open | fixed | wontfix | ...  (consumer-owned)
      reportIds  : [reportId, ...] every /BugReports id folded into this issue
      channelKey : which configured Discord channel the thread lives in (see
                   resolve_channel). Absent on threads created before the
                   bug/feedback channel split -- those are all in the default
                   channel, which is exactly what the fallback assumes.
      created    : server ms
      updated    : server ms

  /BugReports/{reportId}/status        set to "triaged" once folded into an issue
  /BugReports/{reportId}/triage        { issueId: <issue key>, updated: server ms }

  /BugReportTriage/prs/{owner__repo__number}   one node per fix PR raised by a
                                       bug-fixer agent, so the merge poller
                                       (bug-report-check-prs.py) can close the
                                       issue out when the PR lands. Registered by
                                       bug-report-apply.py -- which is the only
                                       point at which both the PR and its issue
                                       are known.
      url        : the GitHub PR URL (also the source of owner/repo/number)
      repoLabel  : the fixer's repo handle ("codex" | "data")
      branch     : the triage/* branch backing the PR
      issueId    : the issue registry key the fix belongs to (not a thread id)
      reportIds  : [reportId, ...] every report the fix closes out
