"""Close out a feedback report once its fix has landed.

Three outward-facing steps, in order (each can be skipped; --dry-run previews all):

  1. Post a developer message onto the reporter's ticket, through the team
     dashboard's tickets API (so it carries the dashboard's dev name, bumps
     lastDevMessageAt and fires the in-app "developer responded" marker).
  2. Set that ticket's status to closed.
  3. Reply "Fixed and Closed" into the report's Discord thread (in #bugs or
     #user-feedback, whichever the thread was opened in).
  4. Archive that thread, so it drops off the forum's active list.

Usage:
  python bug-close-out.py <reportId> [options]

Options:
  --dry-run              print what would be sent; write nothing, post nothing
  --message TEXT         override the ticket message (default: the thank-you line)
  --discord-text TEXT    override the Discord reply (default: "Fixed and Closed")
  --dev-name NAME        dashboard display name to post as (default: Codex Developers)
  --thread ID            Discord thread id, when the report has no triage.issueId
  --no-ticket            skip steps 1+2 (Discord only)
  --no-discord           skip steps 3+4 (ticket only)
  --no-archive           post the reply but leave the thread open

Config / secrets, in resolution order:
  dashboard url       bug-report-config.json "dashboardUrl"     -> DASHBOARD_URL_DEFAULT
  tickets password    $BUG_TICKETS_PASSWORD -> config "ticketsPassword"
                      -> TICKETS_PASSWORD in internal-dashboards/wrangler.jsonc,
                      looked for at $INTERNAL_DASHBOARDS_WRANGLER, then under
                      config "dmhubRepo", then in any ancestor of the cwd, then
                      in a dmhub repo sibling to this script
  discord webhook     bug-report-config.json "channels"/"discordWebhook", picked
                      by the thread's channelKey (see bugreport_lib)
  discord bot token   $DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN -> config "discordBotToken". Step 4 only;
                      webhooks cannot archive threads. Absent => step 4 is skipped
                      with a note, which is not a failure.

Not every report has a ticket: tickets are only opened for bug-type reports filed
by ticket-aware clients. A missing ticket is reported and skipped, not an error --
the Discord step still runs. Prints a per-step summary; exits non-zero if a step
that was meant to run failed.

The same three steps run automatically, without a human, when a fix PR raised by
triage is merged -- see bug-report-check-prs.py. Use this script for the manual
case: a fix that shipped some other way, or a report you want to close by hand.
