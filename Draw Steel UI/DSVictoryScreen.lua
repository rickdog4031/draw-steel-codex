-- DSVictoryScreen
--
-- A full-screen "the heroes have won" celebration. When the director presses
-- "Award Victory" on the initiative bar, the live encounter's victoryAwarded flag is
-- flipped (LiveEncounter.victoryAwarded, networked inside the initiative queue). Every
-- client polls that flag; when it is set the normal initiative display is hidden (see
-- MCDMInitiativeBar.lua) and this screen takes over: the screen darkens, a "Victory"
-- title sweeps in across the top, and the heroes fade in one by one with their
-- portraits, names, Stamina, and how their Recoveries changed over the fight. Dead
-- heroes are marked DEAD.
--
-- The same screen doubles as the DEFEAT screen: "Declare Defeat" (initiative bar
-- strip when a script defeat condition passes, or the combat settings menu at any
-- time) flips LiveEncounter.defeatAwarded instead. In defeat mode the title reads
-- DEFEAT in red, the Monsters tab opens first (the victors take the spotlight),
-- the Victories award controls are hidden, and the Ajax core-asset painting fades
-- in behind the cards (DEFEAT_BACKGROUND_IMAGE below -- lazily assigned so it is
-- only ever downloaded when a defeat screen actually shows).
--
-- The director gets a "Proceed" button at the bottom; pressing it ends combat and
-- clears the victory state, which closes the screen for every client.
--
-- A Heroes / Monsters tab strip under the title switches the card row between the
-- hero cards and one card per monster initiative grouping (a squad with its
-- captain, grouped monsters, or a lone monster -- see LiveEncounter:GetMonsterGroups),
-- each showing the group's portrait, survivors, and the fun role it earned from
-- the per-round monster stats (ComputeMonsterRoles below). Tab state is local to
-- each client; the Award animation switches back to Heroes automatically.
--
-- The screen is created once and mounted at the top of the game HUD (see GameHud.lua).
-- It reads its state straight from dmhub.initiativeQueue.liveEncounter, so no separate
-- synced document is needed -- the live encounter is already networked to all clients.

-- Hero roles
--
-- Fun titles awarded from the live encounter's per-round hero stats (see
-- Draw Steel Core Rules/STATS_TRACKING.md for the stats and their layout).
-- Candidate roles are evaluated in priority order, most interesting first, and
-- assignment runs in three passes. EVERY hero finishes with a role; the passes
-- decide how good it is.
--
--  1. WINNERS. Each role goes to its single top-ranked hero, and each hero
--     shows just one role, so a hero who both dealt the most damage and opened
--     with the round-1 Initiator strike shows only Damage Dealer. Initiator is
--     left on the table -- it does NOT slide down to the runner-up here. A role
--     awarded in this pass always means "nobody beat you at this".
--  2. CASCADE. The roles pass 1 left on the table are then offered to their
--     RUNNER-UP, but only onto a hero who was best at nothing -- a hero who
--     already won something never picks up a second-place title, and a role
--     that pass 1 did award is never handed out twice. This is what fills the
--     card of a hero who was second-best at everything.
--  3. FLOOR. Whatever is still blank gets a floor role, which may repeat across
--     several cards: Pacifist / Tourist for a hero who dealt no damage at all,
--     and Backbone, the catch-all, for everyone else. Between them these cover
--     every hero unconditionally, so a blank role slot is now a bug -- see the
--     `fallback` field below.
--
-- Each awarded role carries `fallback`: nil for a pass-1 win, "cascade" for a
-- pass-2 runner-up title, "floor" for a pass-3 one. Anything non-nil means the
-- role set had nothing this hero was actually best at, which is what the
-- hero_role_fallback analytics event measures (MCDMEncounter.lua).
--
-- Stats consumed: damageDealt, damageTaken, damagePrevention, overkill, kills,
-- minionKills, criticals (recorded by the shipped Critical Hit content),
-- tierRolls, edges, banes, spacesMoved, forcedMovementDealt,
-- forcedMovementTaken, standsFirm, allyDamageDealt, enemyTurnDamage,
-- heroicResourcesGained, heroicResourcesSpent, conditionsInflicted.
