-- ============================================================================
-- CLASSIC CHARACTER PANEL
--
-- The panel as it stood before the hero rework, kept whole so the
-- dev:testcharpanel setting can switch back to it. Every function here is a
-- verbatim restore from commit 62c26479 apart from its name: the ones whose
-- reworked counterpart still owns the original name carry a Classic suffix.
--
-- Do NOT extend these. They exist to be switched to, not developed; when the
-- rework comes off its flag this whole block goes with it.
-- ============================================================================

--- Collapse one of the stamina row's action boxes when the token is a monster.
---
--- Monsters fold DMG / STAMINA / HEAL / TEMP into the health bar's hover
--- controls (TacPanel.BarAdjustControls), which is all the room their column
--- beside the portrait has. Heroes keep the boxes.
---
--- Each box has to forward setToken/refreshToken to refreshCharacter itself:
--- the panel tree is driven by setToken, and refreshCharacter only fires where
--- an element re-fires it.
