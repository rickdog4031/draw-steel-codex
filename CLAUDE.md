# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

This is the **draw-steel-codex** repository — the Lua mod source code for [DMHub](https://dmhub.app), a tabletop RPG virtual tabletop (VTT). Specifically, it implements the **Draw Steel** (MCDM) game system on top of the DMHub engine. The code runs inside the DMHub app; there is no standalone build process, test runner, or linter to invoke from the command line.

## How the Code is Loaded

What loads, and in what order, is decided by the **CodeMod records in the cloud**: each mod's file list, in its stored order, with mods ordered by their dependencies. Dependencies must come before the files that use them. A `.lua` file on disk that is not in its mod's cloud file list is never loaded.

`main.lua` at the root is **informational only and is never run**. The engine generates it (`CodeModManager.CreateDefinitionsIndexFile`) as an index for editors and LuaLS: a flat list of `require(...)` calls mirroring the cloud file lists as they were when it was generated, so it can be stale. Each `require` uses the pattern `ModuleName_XXXX.FileName`, where `ModuleName_XXXX` is a subdirectory name (with a hex suffix that acts as a module ID). Editing it changes nothing at runtime.

Each Lua file begins with:
```lua
local mod = dmhub.GetModLoading()
```
This gives access to the current module interface. The `mod` object is used to track module lifecycle (e.g., `mod.unloaded`).

**IMPORTANT: New top-level Lua files must be registered through the DMHub MCP CodeMod workflow.** A file placed on disk is not part of its CodeMod, and manually adding a `require` to `main.lua` is not a substitute for registration. While DMHub is running, call `mcp__dmhub__register_lua_file` with a path of the form `<mod directory>/<file>.lua` (and optional `before` or `after` ordering), then confirm that Firebase persistence succeeded. Prefer registering the safe baseline before substantive edits; the tool preserves an existing local file if work has already begun. Do not hand-edit `main.lua` to register a new file. If the MCP bridge is unavailable, stop and ask the user rather than falling back to a manual `require`.

## Repository Structure

Each top-level directory is a "mod" (module) loaded by DMHub. Key layers:

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Definitions/` | LuaLS type stubs for the DMHub engine API (not executed — documentation only). All engine globals (`dmhub`, `gui`, `game`, `creature`, etc.) are declared here. |
| `DMHub Utils/` | Shared utility library: `Utils.lua` (table/string helpers), `GoblinScript.lua` (formula expression evaluator), `CoroutineUtils.lua`, `MarkdownRenderUtils.lua`. |
| `DMHub Core UI/` | Core UI framework: `Gui.lua` wraps the engine `gui` global, `Hud.lua`, `DockablePanel.lua`, `Scrollable.lua`, etc. |
| `DMHub Core Panels/` | Application panels: Chat, Character panel, Map tools, Compendium, Dev tools, etc. |
| `DMHub Game Rules/` | Base game rules system: `BasicRules.lua`, `ActivatedAbility.lua`, `Creature.lua`, `Character.lua`, `Class.lua`, `Condition.lua`, `Equipment.lua`, etc. This layer is generic/system-agnostic. |
| `Draw Steel Core Rules/` | The Draw Steel (MCDM) game system implementation built on top of DMHub Game Rules. `MCDMRules.lua` calls `GameSystem.ClearRules()` then sets DS-specific names (Stamina, Characteristics, Power Rolls, etc.). Most `MCDM*.lua` and `DS*.lua` files here extend or override base game types. |
| `Draw Steel Character Builder/` | New character creation wizard UI and state machine. |
| `Draw Steel UI/` | DS-specific UI panels (action bar, character sheet, class/kit editors, initiative, etc.). |
| `Draw Steel V/` | Newer DS feature panels (encounter, heroes, negotiation, downtime, fishing, chessboard, etc.). |
| `Draw Steel Ability Behaviors/` | Individual ability behavior implementations (`AbilityDamage`, `AbilityForcedMovementLoc`, `AbilityTemporaryEffects`, etc.). |
| `Draw Steel Modifiers/` | Modifier implementations (`ModifierCaptain`, `ModifierForcedMovement`, `ModifierInvisibility`, etc.). |
| `Downtime Projects/` | Downtime project system (rules + UI). |
| `DMHub Compendium/` | Compendium browser and editors for game content. |
| `DMHub CharacterSheet Base/` | Base character sheet framework. |
| `DocumentSystem/` | Rich document/journal system with Markdown, images, embedded dice rolls, etc. |

## Crows

**Crows** is a separate MCDM playtest game (not Draw Steel) implemented as the `Crowdex/` module, layered on top of the Draw Steel codex by wrapping/overriding its types and functions. **All Crows-specific Lua changes must be made in `Crowdex/`** -- keep shared Draw Steel files generic, adding only minimal generic hooks there when an override point is genuinely needed. The Crows rules and documentation are the official MCDM playtest booklets in `Crowdex/` as `.md` files (e.g. `01 MCDM Crows The Rules Booklet...`, `02 ...Characters...`, `03 ...Monsters...`); content imported into the compendium lives in `compendium/import/crows-*.yaml`.

## Core Architecture Patterns

### Game Types
Game objects are declared with `RegisterGameType("TypeName")` or `RegisterGameType("TypeName", "ParentType")`. This registers a type in the engine's serialization system. You then add default fields and methods directly on the global:
```lua
CharacterCondition = RegisterGameType("CharacterCondition", "CharacterFeature")
CharacterCondition.name = "New Condition"
CharacterCondition.tableName = "charConditions"
function CharacterCondition:SoundEvent() ... end
```

Fields prefixed with `_tmp_` are **transient** -- the engine skips them during serialization. Use `_tmp_` fields for ephemeral runtime state that should not be saved to the database or sent over the network. Reading a `_tmp_` field that was never set will error; use `obj:try_get("_tmp_foo")` for safe access.

Extending a type from another file (common in `Draw Steel Core Rules/`):
```lua
-- Extend creature with Draw Steel fields
creature.minion = false
local g_base = creature.Invalidate
function creature:Invalidate()
    g_base(self)
    -- DS-specific invalidation
end
```

### Data Tables
Game data is stored in named tables accessed via `dmhub.GetTable("tableName")`. Iterate with `unhidden_pairs(t)` (skips soft-deleted entries). Write with `dmhub.SetAndUploadObject(tableName, id, obj)`.

### Modifying Token Properties
When changing any value on a token's properties outside of the character sheet, you **must** wrap mutations in `token:ModifyProperties{}`. This observes the changes, uploads only the diffs to the cloud, and supports undo.

```lua
token:ModifyProperties{
    description = "Spend a recovery",
    execute = function()
        -- modify token.properties inside here
        token.properties:SpendRecovery()
    end,
}
```

Options:
- `execute` (required) -- function that mutates `token.properties`
- `description` (string) -- human-readable label for the undo stack
- `undoable` (boolean) -- defaults to true; set false for non-undoable changes
- `combine` (boolean) -- if true, combines with other uploads this frame as a transaction

**Exception**: Code running inside the character sheet/builder modifies properties directly without `ModifyProperties`, since the sheet manages its own upload lifecycle.

**Deprecated**: `BeginChanges`/`CompleteChanges` -- use `ModifyProperties` instead.

### Shared Documents
Shared cloud documents provide key-value storage that syncs across all clients in a game session. They are used for real-time shared state such as chat events, audio grid slots, global resources, initiative data, and downtime project shares. Unlike Data Tables (which store game content definitions), documents hold live session state.

**Getting a snapshot:**
```lua
local doc = mod:GetDocumentSnapshot("myDocId")
```
The `docid` is any unique string. The returned snapshot has a `.data` table (the document contents) and a `.path` string (for monitoring).

**Reading data:**
```lua
local value = doc.data.someKey
```

**Writing data** (must wrap mutations in `BeginChange`/`CompleteChange`):
```lua
local doc = mod:GetDocumentSnapshot("myDocId")
doc:BeginChange()
doc.data.someKey = newValue
doc:CompleteChange("Description of change")
```
`CompleteChange` accepts an optional second argument table, e.g. `{undoable = false}`.

**Monitoring for changes in UI panels** -- set `monitorGame` to the document path so `refreshGame` fires when any client changes the document:
```lua
gui.Panel{
    monitorGame = mod:GetDocumentSnapshot("myDocId").path,
    refreshGame = function(element)
        local doc = mod:GetDocumentSnapshot("myDocId")
        -- update UI from doc.data
    end,
}
```

**Checkpoint backups** -- register a document so it is included in game-state checkpoint saves:
```lua
mod:RegisterDocumentForCheckpointBackups("myDocId")
```

**Helper for path** -- `mod:GetDocumentPath("myDocId")` returns the monitoring path string directly (equivalent to `mod:GetDocumentSnapshot("myDocId").path`).

### UI (gui panels)
UI is built with `gui.Panel(args)`, `gui.Label(args)`, `gui.Input(args)`, etc. Panels are declarative tables with style properties and event callbacks (`click`, `change`, `create`, `think`, `refreshGame`). Panels that need to react to data changes use `monitorstate` or `monitor` fields.

**Important:** When using padding (`hpad`, `vpad`, `pad`), always set `borderBox = true` so that padding is included in the declared width/height rather than added on top. This prevents overflow and matches CSS border-box behavior. See the Spacing section in UI_BEST_PRACTICES.md for details.

See **[UI_BEST_PRACTICES.md](UI_BEST_PRACTICES.md)** and **[ThemeEngine.md](ThemeEngine.md)** for detailed guidelines on building UI (rendering, performance, events, styling, layout, etc.). For the canonical color tokens, gradient tokens, and class vocabulary registered by `DefaultStyles.lua` — and prescriptive guidance on which token/class to reach for — see **[DefaultStyles.md](DefaultStyles.md)**. For the panel-level design language — row grammar, section headers, separators, hover/selected states, iconography, and the checklist for bringing an old panel onto it — see **[STYLE_GUIDE.md](STYLE_GUIDE.md)**.

### GoblinScript
GoblinScript is an expression language (evaluates formula strings) used for ability costs, damage formulas, prerequisites, etc. Compile with `GoblinScript.Compile(formula, symbolTable)` and evaluate with `GoblinScript.Execute(compiled, context)`. See **[GoblinScript_Guide.md](GoblinScript_Guide.md)** for the full language reference including semantics, operator precedence, evaluation model, all available symbols, and real examples.

### Module Lifecycle
Guard against stale closures using `mod.unloaded`:
```lua
local mod = dmhub.GetModLoading()
dmhub.Schedule(delay, function()
    if mod.unloaded then return end
    -- do work
end)
```

### Settings
Persistent settings use the `setting{}` constructor:
```lua
local mySetting = setting{
    id = "mysettingid",
    name = "My Setting",
    default = true,
    onchange = function() ... end,
}
```

### Panel Background Processes
A dockable panel can keep work running after the panel itself is closed by registering a **background process** -- a coroutine tracked by the panel framework. While any process for a panel is running, the panel's icon-rail button shows a small spinning gear (accent-colored) in its bottom-left corner, whether the panel is open or not. The first client is the Monster AI: Start AI registers a process, and closing the panel does not stop the AI.

```lua
local process = DockablePanel.StartProcess{
    panel = "Monster AI",          -- the DockablePanel.Register name
    id = "monster-ai",             -- unique per panel; restarting an id replaces it
    coroutine = function(process)  -- runs as a dmhub.Coroutine
        while true do
            coroutine.yield(0.1)
            if mod.unloaded or process.stopRequested then
                return
            end
            -- do work
        end
    end,
}
```

Stopping is **cooperative**: `DockablePanel.StopProcess(panelName, id)` (or `process:Stop()`) only sets `process.stopRequested`; the coroutine must poll it -- and its own `mod.unloaded` -- and return. `DockablePanel.HasActiveProcess(panelName)` reports liveness (it is what the rail gear reads), and `DockablePanel.GetProcess(panelName, id)` returns the handle. Full details in the "Panel background processes" section of `DMHub Core UI/DockablePanel.lua`.

## Lua File Constraints

**Syntax-check before you deploy.** The repo ships a Lua 5.4.7 interpreter built from the
same source as the engine's `lua54.dll` — do not go looking for one elsewhere:

```bash
../dependencies/lua/bin/luac.exe -p SomeFile.lua
```

`-p` parses without executing, so it works on files full of engine globals. Actually
*running* a codex file with `lua.exe` will fail on the first `import`/`dmhub`/`gui`
reference; that is expected. No codex file uses the engine's `@if`/`@else`/`@end`
preprocessor directives any more, so a raw `luac -p` sweep is clean with no special
handling; see "Checking Lua Yourself" in the root [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).

**Do not leave a file worse typed than you found it.** `luac -p` only catches syntax.
The type checker is `../tools/lua-typing/check.ps1` (run it from the repo root), and
`tools/lua-typing/baseline.json` holds a per-file ceiling; the run exits 1 when a file goes
over it, naming the file and the delta. Run it before you call Lua work finished. Use
`-Changed` while editing (~15 s; only the git-changed files are diagnosed, with the rest
of the codex loaded as a library so nothing shows as undefined) and the plain whole-codex
run (~3.5 min) before committing -- only the full run catches an edit that breaks typing
in a file you did not change. Do not use `-Target` on a subdirectory: that loses the
workspace and reports everything defined elsewhere as undefined.

The ceiling has slack in it because LuaLS is not deterministic here (the same code checks
to a number ~12 wide), so do not read small count changes as signal in either direction.

Adding to a file that is already over its ceiling is fine as long as you do not push it
further. If your change genuinely improves a file, re-record with `-UpdateBaseline` and
say so in the commit message. See [`LUA_TYPING_REFERENCE.md`](../LUA_TYPING_REFERENCE.md)
for the annotation conventions that keep new code clean -- `@cast` in event handlers,
typed locals for `panel.data`, `core.Vector2` on property writes.

**ASCII only.** The DMHub Lua runtime does not handle non-ASCII characters in source files. All Lua files — including comments and EmmyLua annotations — must contain only ASCII characters (bytes 0-127). Never use em dashes, curly quotes, ellipses, or any other Unicode punctuation. Use plain ASCII equivalents instead: `-` or `:` instead of em dashes, `"` instead of curly quotes, `...` instead of ellipses.

**Forward-declare self-referencing locals.** In Lua, `local x = expr` does not bring `x` into scope until `expr` finishes evaluating. If a closure inside the initializer needs to reference the variable (common with gui panel event handlers like `click`, `change`, `think`), you must split declaration and assignment:
```lua
-- WRONG: panelVar is not in scope inside the click handler
local panelVar = gui.Panel{ click = function() panelVar:SetClass("hidden", true) end }

-- RIGHT: forward-declare, then assign
local panelVar
panelVar = gui.Panel{ click = function() panelVar:SetClass("hidden", true) end }
```

**Reading a missing method on a game-typed instance raises.** Instances created with `RegisterGameType` error on reads of undefined fields AND undefined methods (e.g. `props.GetImplementationStatus` raises "Attempt to read unknown field ... in type creature" when props is creature-typed). Do not use the `props.SomeMethod == nil` presence-check pattern unless the instance's type is guaranteed. The stored `typeName` field is NOT a reliable gate either -- some compendium monster assets report `typeName == "monster"` while their properties actually bind as plain `creature`. The dependable guard is `pcall`:
```lua
local value = nil
pcall(function() value = props:SomeMonsterOnlyMethod() end)
if value == nil then --[[ not available ]] end
```

**`cond(a, b, c)` is a function, not a ternary -- it does NOT short-circuit.** It is defined as `function cond(a,b,c) if a then return b else return c end`, so Lua evaluates `a`, `b`, AND `c` before the call. Never put an expression that can error in the branch you expect to be skipped:
```lua
-- WRONG: "The " .. token.name is evaluated even when canSeeName is false,
-- so a nil name throws "concatenate a nil value (field 'name')" regardless.
local s = cond(token.canLocalPlayerSeeName, "The " .. token.name, "This creature")

-- RIGHT: use a real if/else when either branch can error (e.g. nil concat/index)
local s = "This creature"
if token.canLocalPlayerSeeName and token.name ~= nil then s = "The " .. token.name end
```

## Comment Style

Write comments (and notes on multiline changes) for a junior dev unfamiliar with this system: concise, plain language, 1-3 lines max. Never simply restate what the code does -- explain what is happening, how to use it, or why it exists. A comment documenting a new function and its variables may run longer than 3 lines.

## Monster Reference Documentation

**[monster-reference.md](monster-reference.md)** contains the complete stat blocks for every monster in Draw Steel Book Two: Monsters. Use this as the authoritative source when implementing or auditing monster YAML files in `compendium/bestiary/`. It includes all abilities, traits, villain actions, malice features, power roll tiers, and stat tables for every creature.

## `Definitions/` Files

These are **LuaLS stub files** (LuaCATS annotations, every file `---@meta`) for the closed-source DMHub engine API, generated from the C# bridge attributes by the engine's `LuaDocumentor` -- never hand-edit them, a regen overwrites the folder. When the engine API has a function you want to call, its signature will be in one of these files. How the stubs, the `GameType` class convention and the checker fit together is in [`../LUA_TYPING_REFERENCE.md`](../LUA_TYPING_REFERENCE.md).

Key stubs:
- `dmhub.lua` — the main `dmhub` global (game state, tokens, scheduling, file I/O, events)
- `gui.lua` / `gui-definitions.lua` — UI panel constructors and Panel class fields/events
- `game.lua` — the `game` global
- `GameRules.lua` — `GameRules` global
- `module.lua` — `module` global for mod management

## Editing Files

Always edit files in the **main copy** of the repository (the clone this file lives in), not in any git worktree under `.claude\worktrees\`. Worktrees are used for isolated agent work only; the user works directly from the main copy.

Do NOT edit `C:\MCDM\dmhubclient\draw-steel-codex\` -- that is a separate, stale fork of the codex embedded in the DMHub client project. It is not what the app loads and changes there go nowhere.

## Deploying Changes to the Running Codex

**Editing the repo alone does not change what the app runs.** The Codex reads checked-out mod source, file by file, from its dev-mod "git folder". The location is the `gitfolder` value in `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\MCDM\Codex\mods\settings.json` (e.g. `C:\Users\theli\codex-dev-mods`). Inside it, each checked-out module is a folder named exactly like the repo's module directory:

```
<gitfolder>\Draw Steel V\EncounterPanel.lua
```

Verify what the app actually loaded by searching `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\MCDM\Codex\Player.log` for `MOD:: READ CONTENTS FOR MOD` lines.

**Use `deploy.ps1` at the repo root**: `.\deploy.ps1` copies every git-modified `.lua` file into its module folder in the git folder; `-Check` dry-runs it; passing repo-relative paths deploys specific files. Run it after any Lua change, then restart or reload the Codex. Rules:

- **Deploy ALL changed files together.** A partial deploy is worse than none: if a UI file is deployed without the rules file it now depends on, the feature errors at runtime with a nil function call and silently fails to appear.
- A module the app has never checked out may not load from the git folder even after its folder is created; if the app still runs the old version after a restart, check the module out for git editing in the Codex's mod tools, then re-run the script.
- Do NOT deploy to `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\MCDM\Codex\mods\<Module_XXXX>\` -- that is the app's own cache, written by the app, and copying files there does nothing.
- The git folder does not sync back to the repo; the repo remains the source of truth for git history.
