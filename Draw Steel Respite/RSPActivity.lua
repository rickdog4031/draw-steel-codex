--- Downtime activities a Respite can offer.
---
--- A feature registers itself here rather than the Respite reaching into it,
--- so the Respite never needs to know which features exist. Registration
--- happens after the game is up, since load order does not guarantee this
--- module is present when a feature's own files run.
---
--- The registry is module state, not document state: it describes what this
--- client can do, and the Respite records only which of them are on offer.
--- @class RSPActivity: GameType
--- @field new fun(o?: table): RSPActivity
--- @field key string
--- @field name string
--- @field paint fun(): Panel the Director's setup fields
--- @field paintPlayer fun(args: table): Panel what a player does with it
--- @field paintDirector fun(args: table): Panel what the Director watches
--- Both paintDirector and needsAttention receive args.since, which is a server
--- time OR a function returning one. Resolve it when you read it: a panel that
--- captures the number can be built before the Respite starts, and a zero
--- there means "report everything ever".
--- @field needsAttention fun(args: table): boolean something the Director must act on
--- @field onStart fun() the Respite has begun and this activity is on offer
--- @field onComplete fun() the Respite is over
--- @field onRested fun() every participant has been rested
--- onComplete and onRested sit either side of the rest, and the difference
--- matters: onComplete still sees the Respite as it was and runs before anybody
--- is rested, while onRested runs after and is the only place to touch what the
--- rest restores.
--- @field journalDetail fun(): string|nil one line about this activity for the write-up
--- @field journalSummary fun(args: table): string[]|nil what args.charid did;
--- receives args.since like paintDirector does
