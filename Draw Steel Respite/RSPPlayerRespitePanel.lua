### Participate

Tick a checkbox to indicate a hero is participating in the Respite. Including the hero in the Respite means the game's mechanics like converting Victories to XP and resetting Recoveries and Stamina will apply to them.

Heroes that do not participate in the Respite will%s be able to participate in downtime activities.

Commit to let your Director know that you're happy with your answer.
