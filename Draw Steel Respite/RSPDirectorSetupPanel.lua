### Setup

Set the terms of the Respite.

**Days Elapsed** is how much time passes. Changing it sets **Downtime Activities** to match; change that separately if the two should differ.

**Downtime Activities** is the number of downtime activities granted - one count for heroes, one for their followers. Each Downtime Activity enables a single project roll or fishing trip.

Leave **Non-participants** ticked to let characters who sit the Respite out still run downtime activities.

Offering the Respite offers players the opportunity to participate.
