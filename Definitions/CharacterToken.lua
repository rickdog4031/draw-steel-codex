--- @field mountedSaddle nil|number (Read-only) Which saddle this token is sitting in on the creature or object it is mounted on, as an index into that creature's saddles. nil when it is not mounted on anything. Pass it back to ClimbOntoCreature to seat the creature in the same saddle again -- restoring a remembered arrangement, for instance.
--- @field riders CharacterToken[] (Read-only) The creatures currently sitting in this token's saddles -- riders and creatures that have climbed it. Empty if nothing is riding it.
--- @field valid boolean (Read-only) true if this token is still valid. If saving a reference to a CharacterToken between frames, this should be checked before using it. It will become invalid if the token is deleted.

--- @field canControlAsUser boolean (Read-only) True if the current user has permissions to control this token in their own right -- they own it, it is in their party, or they are the GM. Unlike canControl, control that a player host (see dmhub.playerHostMode) has only because its machine hosts the game does NOT count -- so this is the check for UI asking 'is this token mine to drive?'. Identical to canControl in every other game. @see canControl
--- @field primaryCharacter boolean (Read-only) True if this is the primary character of the current user.
--- @field playerControlledAndPrimary boolean (Read-only) True if this is the primary character of a player.

--- @field portraitFrame nil|string
--- @field portraitFrameMaterial nil|string Id of a premium frame material registered with dmhub.tokenFrames:Register that lights this token's frame ring (normal map, roughness/metallic, sheen). nil or empty = plain frame texture. This does not change portraitFrame: set portraitFrame to the material's albedo asset as well, so clients and UI that only know the flat frame still show it. Upload with UploadAppearance.
--- @field teleportAnimation string The id of the registered token animation (see dmhub.tokenAnimations:RegisterTeleport) played when this token teleports. Empty string -> no animation, logical teleport only.
--- @field animation CharacterTokenAnimationLua The per-token animation interface used inside a token-animation callback. Provides Light / Billboard / PlayEffect / Tween / SetVisible primitives plus a sound passthrough. Spawns made while a scripted animation is running are tracked and stopped automatically when the animation ends.
--- @field offTokenPortrait string
--- @field inspectPortrait string Up-close 'inspect' variant of offTokenPortrait. For tokens rendering via a spine animation this returns the '#spineinspect:tokenid' image id, which renders a separate live spine portrait framed with the registry's inspectZoom / inspectXOffset / inspectYOffset (independent of the regular portrait* fields). For non-spine tokens this returns the same value as offTokenPortrait, so callers can use it uniformly.
--- @field portrait string
--- @field hasSpineAnimation boolean True if this token currently has an active spine animation (i.e. its portraitid resolved to a spine registry entry and the spine renderer was instantiated).
--- @field popoutPortrait boolean
--- @field popoutScale number
--- @field portraitBackground nil|string
--- @field appearance CharacterAppearance (Read-only) Information about the character's appearance.
--- @field wieldedObjectsOverride nil|{mainhand: nil|string, offhand: nil|string, belt: nil|string}

--- @field portraitRect Vector4 The rectangle within the portrait to display for this token.
--- @field radiusInTiles number The radius of the token, in tiles.
--- @field pos Vector2 (Read-only) The world position the token is at.
--- @field lookAt nil|Vector2 (Read-only) The world position this token is currently 'looking at', or nil if it isn't looking at anything. Priority: (1) if the token is actively being dragged, the mouse cursor; (2) else if the token is moving along a path, the path's final destination; (3) else if an ability is being cast (see spine.setCurrentCastingToken / setCurrentCastingTargets), then if this token is the caster, the first target's position, else the caster's position; (4) otherwise nil. If the token has a spine animation with an eye IK bone (see spine.register's eyeik option), the bone is driven toward this point each frame, scaled by eyeMult and clamped by eyeRange.
--- @field posWithParallax Vector2 (Read-only) The world position the token is at, including adjustments due to parallax.
--- @field portraitZoom number
--- @field portraitOffset Vector2

--- @field creatureDimensions Vector2 (Read-only) The width/height of the token.
--- @field chargeDistance number
--- @field lookAtMouse boolean
--- @field floorIndex number
--- @field initiativeStatus InitiativeStatus (Read-only) the initiative status of the token.
--- @field countFloorsWithVisionAbove number The number of floors above this token that the token can 'look up' at. Generally this requires there being a hole directly above the token. A roof or canopy floor ends the count: roofs are shown from below by the roof/canopy cutaway and are never looked up at.
--- @field countFloorsAbove number The number of floors above this token, regardless of whether there are holes above them. A roof or canopy floor ends the count.

--- Put this token into a saddle on another creature, as though it had been dragged onto one -- this is how a creature climbs another creature. A free saddle is used if the creature has one; otherwise an AD-HOC saddle is created for the climber, so a creature with no saddles at all can still be climbed. The ad-hoc saddle exists only while the climber is in it. Pass saddleIndex (as read from the climber's mountedSaddle) to ask for a particular saddle -- restoring a remembered arrangement -- and the first free saddle is used instead if that one is out of range or taken. Returns false if the creature cannot be climbed (it is this token, it is already riding this token, or every saddle is taken).

function CharacterToken:ClimbOntoCreature(mountToken, saddleIndex) end

--- Get out of the saddle this token is in (on a creature or an object) and stand at loc. Pass a loc at the height of the saddle to have the creature drop from there -- the usual falling rules then apply -- or a loc on the ground for it to climb down safely. When slide is true the token climbs down over the usual movement animation instead of appearing at loc; leave it false for a fall, where the drop is the animation. Returns false if the token was not in a saddle.

--- jumpHeight (only meaningful with movementType='jump'): the jump distance in tiles; the mover clears height-limited walls up to this many tiles tall.
--- freeMovement: this move is not the creature's move action, so it is exempt from the strict:movement remaining-budget clamp. Set it for ability-granted shifts and moves.
--- playerMovement: the move was initiated directly by the user (e.g. the arrow keys). It is subject to the same gates as a mouse drag: the user must control the token, the game must not be frozen (unless the user is the Director), and under Strictly Enforce Movement Rules it must be this token's turn in combat. Returns nil when blocked.

function CharacterToken:SetSpineAnimation(options) end

--- Configure idle-fidget animations on this token's spine. Pass a list of animation names to interrupt the current loop with periodically; pass nil or an empty list to disable. period is the base interval in seconds (default 30); each token's actual period is jittered +/-10% based on its tokenid hash so identical creatures don't fidget in unison. Timing runs against the synced server clock so all clients trigger the same fidget at the same wall-clock instant. Fidgets only trigger while the current animation is a loop, so explicit non-loop one-shots (attacks, etc.) won't be interrupted.

--- Set the active skin on this token's spine. Skins control which attachment images are bound to slots, independent of which animation is playing -- e.g. swap a 'winded' skin to expose injury attachments without changing the running animation. Pass nil to revert to the skeleton's first declared skin (typically 'default'). No-op if the token doesn't have an active spine animation. Logs a warning and is a no-op if the named skin doesn't exist on this skeleton.
--- @param skinName nil|string

--- Reveals the token's character sheet, going to the given tab by default
--- @param tabid? string
function CharacterToken:ShowSheet(tabid) end

--- The vision of the other token you have. 1 = full vision. 0 = complete occlusion. 0.5 = half visible, 0.25 = three-quarters cover. Optionally pass pierceSurfaces to ignore thin walls. The mode argument is "full" (default) to use the full token-aware targeting calculation that samples multiple rays across token footprints, or "basic" to cast a single center-to-center ray (faster but less accurate for large tokens or intervening creatures).

Landing lower is always allowed. Mirrors Move with movementType='jump', so the set matches where such a jump can actually go.
