--- @return nil|MapFloorLua
function game.GetFloor(floorid) end

--- Deletes a floor and all its child floors from the current map.

--- @param unpatch? table<string, any>
function game.PrepareDeleteFloor(floorid, evacuationFloor, patch, unpatch) end

--- Merges two floors together, combining their terrain, objects, and raster data. Returns the resulting floor ID.
--- @param floorid string|number The target floor ID.
--- @param srcid string|number The source floor ID to merge into the target.
--- @return string
function game.MergeFloors(floorid, srcid) end

--- Prepares patch and unpatch dictionaries for merging two floors. Used internally by MergeFloors.

--- Changes the active map, optionally navigating to a specific floor.
--- @param map MapManifestLua The map to switch to.
--- @param floor nil|MapFloorLua Optional floor to navigate to.
function game.ChangeMap(map, floor) end

--- @param floor nil|string|MapFloorLua
--- @return boolean
function game.FloorIsAboveGround(floor) end

--- Refreshes game details from the server. Options table can specify currentMap, floors, and tokens to selectively refresh.
--- @param options nil|table Optional refresh filters with currentMap (boolean), floors (string[]), and tokens (string[]).
function game.Refresh(options) end

--- Creates a new character of the given type and subtype, returning its ID. Defaults to type 'character' and empty subtype.
--- @param chartype nil|string The character type, e.g. 'character'.
--- @param subtype nil|string The character subtype.
--- @return string
function game.CreateCharacter(chartype, subtype) end

--- Deletes multiple characters by their IDs.

function game.DeleteCharacters(charids) end

--- Looks up an object instance on a floor by its floor and object IDs.

function game.LookupObject(floorid, objectid) end

--- Gets all objects on visible floors that have an affinity to the specified character.

--- @return table
function game.GetObjectsWithAffinityToCharacter(charid) end

--- Gets all auras active at the given location. Returns nil if no auras are found.

function game.GetAurasAtLoc(loc) end

--- Gets a character token by its ID. Returns nil if not found.

--- @param tokenidList string[] A table of token ID strings to unsummon.
function game.UnsummonTokens(tokenidList) end

--- Spawns a token from a bestiary entry at the given location locally without uploading. Pass a nil loc to create the character without putting it on a map -- it exists in the game and can be placed later, like any character that hasn't been dropped on the map yet. Returns the created token, or nil if the bestiary entry is not found.
--- @param id string The bestiary entry ID.
--- @param loc nil|Loc The location to spawn at, or nil to create the character unplaced.

--- Forces a refresh of all character token visuals.
function game.UpdateCharacterTokens() end

--- Gets a map manifest by its ID. Returns nil if not found.

--- Creates a new map with the given options and returns its GUID.
--- @param options nil|table Optional map creation settings.
--- @return string
function game.CreateMap(options) end

--- Asynchronously duplicates a map and calls the callback when complete.
--- @param mapid string The ID of the map to duplicate.
--- @param oncomplete function Called when duplication is complete.
function game.DuplicateMap(mapid, oncomplete) end

--- Lists the maps in another of the user's games (one from lobby.games), in that game's map order. Each entry has the map's id, name, floorCount, and folder (the name of the folder it is in there, or nil). Reads the other game's data without entering it. Calls options.success with the list, or options.error with a message.
--- @param options {gameid: string, success: nil|fun(maps: {id: string, name: string, floorCount: integer, folder: nil|string}[]), error: nil|fun(message: string)}
function game.ListOtherGameMaps(options) end

--- Looks up a preview for a map in another of the user's games. result.imported is true when the map was made from an imported image (it has an object with a Map component); then result.imageid is a bgimage id for that image, registered for this session; width and height are its pixel size when the image record has one, else 0 (usual for map images). Maps built by hand have no image. Downloads the map's floors, so call it only for maps being shown. Calls options.success with the result, or options.error with a message.
--- @param options {gameid: string, mapid: string, success: nil|fun(result: {imported: boolean, imageid: nil|string, width: nil|integer, height: nil|integer}), error: nil|fun(message: string)}
function game.GetOtherGameMapPreview(options) end

--- Copies a map from another of the user's games into the current game under fresh ids: its floors, objects, walls and terrain, and the records of any images and custom objects it uses from that game's own asset store. Tokens, teleporter links and the map's folder are not copied; the copy goes at the top level of the map list, named options.name when given. Calls options.success with the new map's id, or options.error with a message.
--- @param options {gameid: string, mapid: string, name: nil|string, success: nil|fun(mapid: string), error: nil|fun(message: string)}
function game.ImportMapFromOtherGame(options) end

--- Begin recording destructive map modifications (heightmap and terrain edits) into a persistent record. All map edits until EndRecordingMapModification is called are captured so they can be reverted later. Recordings with the same key merge into a single record, grouping the edits of one ability cast.
--- @param options {key: nil|string, name: nil|string, casterid: nil|string, casterName: nil|string, floorid: nil|string, loc: nil|{x: number, y: number}}
function game.BeginRecordingMapModification(options) end

--- End the active map modification recording, persisting the record if any map edits were captured. Safe to call when no recording is active.
function game.EndRecordingMapModification() end

--- Begin batching wall-voxel column synchronization. Column terrain operations remain current locally, but their server patches and the expensive map rebuild are deferred until EndWallVoxelBatch. Batches nest: Begin/End are refcounted and only the outermost End publishes, so a helper that batches internally composes with a batched caller. Pair every Begin with an End in the same synchronous burst -- a batch left open is flushed when the next one starts on a later frame, and may not span a coroutine yield.
function game.BeginWallVoxelBatch() end

--- End the active wall-voxel batch. The outermost End publishes all accumulated terrain-operation edits in one non-undoable patch and rebuilds the map once if any column changed; an inner End of a nested batch just decrements the count. Safe to call when no batch is active.
function game.EndWallVoxelBatch() end

--- Attach a wall-voxel object (as returned by floor:SpawnObjectLocal) to the active map modification recording. Wall voxels persist outside the map document, so recordings reference them directly instead of capturing commands; deleting the record destroys whichever of its voxels still survive. No-op if no recording is active.
--- @param obj LuaObjectInstance The spawned wall-voxel object.
function game.AddMapModificationVoxel(obj) end

--- Get the recorded map modifications for the current map, sorted newest first. Each entry has id, key, name, casterid, casterName, floorid, x, y, timestamp, count (the number of captured edit commands), voxelCount (wall voxels recorded, for wall-building records), and voxelsRemaining (how many of those voxels still exist on the map).
--- @return {id: string, key: string, name: string, casterid: nil|string, casterName: nil|string, floorid: string, x: number, y: number, timestamp: number, count: number, voxelCount: number, voxelsRemaining: number}[]
function game.GetMapModifications() end

--- Revert a recorded map modification, restoring the captured pre-modification state, and delete its record. For wall-building records this destroys whichever recorded wall voxels still survive. Command reverts are a single undoable step (undoing re-applies the modification and restores the record); wall-voxel removal is not undoable.
--- @param id string The modification record id, as returned by GetMapModifications.
function game.DeleteMapModification(id) end
