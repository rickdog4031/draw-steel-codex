---@meta

--- Lua interface for a shop item, providing read/write access to its name, price, images, and other metadata.
--- @class ShopItemLua
--- @field name string The display name of this shop item.
--- @field details string The detailed description text of this shop item.
--- @field keywords string Comma-separated keywords for searching.
--- @field artistid string The identifier of the artist who created this item.
--- @field price number The price in tokens.
--- @field autoInstall boolean Whether this module auto-installs when purchased.
--- @field hasBundle boolean True if this shop item includes a bundle of other items.
--- @field bundle table<string, boolean> A table of bundled item IDs mapped to true. Read/write.
--- @field hasAnimatedTokens boolean True if this is an AnimatedTokens item that grants one or more animated tokens.
--- @field animatedTokens table<string, boolean> A table of animated-token spine registry names (e.g. 'lightbender') mapped to true, granted by this item. Read/write. Only meaningful for AnimatedTokens-type items.
--- @field images string[] List of image asset identifiers for this shop item's gallery.
--- @field tileImage string The image asset identifier used for this item's shop tile (grid cards and cart rows), or an empty string when the tile just uses the first gallery image. Normally one of the entries in images. Ignored for Dice items, whose tiles come from dicePreview/diceBanner.
--- @field heroImage string The image asset identifier shown as the main image on this item's details page, or an empty string when the details page just uses the first gallery image. Normally one of the entries in images -- typically the wide/banner-shaped shot, where the tile uses a squarer one. Ignored for Dice items, whose details art comes from dicePreview/diceBanner.
--- @field itemType string The type of this shop item as a string ('Dice', 'Module', 'Bundle', 'Bandwidth', 'AnimatedTokens', 'None').
--- @field assetid string The underlying asset identifier this item grants access to.
--- @field units number The number of units for quantity-based items (e.g. bandwidth).
--- @field diceBanner table The featured-dice banner customization for this Dice item: a table with backgroundImage, foregroundImage (Core-asset image guids; empty means that layer is transparent), diceScale, dieX, dieY, dieSize (dice transform), spinDirection (degrees the idle spin axis is rotated about the screen-normal Z axis; 0 = default vertical spin, 180 = reversed, 90 = tumbling -- speed stays constant), textPlacement ('left'/'right'/'topleft'/'topright'/'bottomleft'/'bottomright') and textOffsetX/textOffsetY. Reading returns a full table, or nil if never configured. Writing a table stores it; writing nil clears it. Only meaningful for Dice-type items.
--- @field dicePreview table The small shop-tile preview customization for this Dice item: the same table shape as diceBanner (backgroundImage, foregroundImage, diceScale, dieX, dieY, dieSize, spinDirection; the text fields are stored but tiles draw no text overlay). Reading returns a full table, or nil if never configured (tiles then derive their look from diceBanner). Writing a table stores it; writing nil clears it back to automatic. Only meaningful for Dice-type items.
--- @field adventurePage table The adventure store page config for this Module item (hero art, tagline, tags, media tabs, cast, ...), as a Lua table. The engine stores it as JSON and never interprets it; the codex's AdventurePage owns the shape. Reading returns the table, or nil if never configured (the item then uses the generic details layout). Writing a table stores it; writing nil clears it. Call Upload() to save.
--- @field onsale boolean True if this item is currently on sale.
--- @field preview boolean True if this item is in preview on the store: shown in the customer-facing shop only to users with the dev:storeitempreview preference enabled. Mutually exclusive with onsale; the admin UI clears it when an item goes live or leaves the store.
--- @field hidden boolean True if this item is soft-hidden from the admin shop list. An item that is on the store (onsale or preview) is never hidden.
--- @field featured boolean True if this item is featured in the shop. Only items that are live on the store (onsale) can be featured.
--- @field ctime number The creation timestamp of this shop item.
--- @field id string The unique identifier of this shop item.
