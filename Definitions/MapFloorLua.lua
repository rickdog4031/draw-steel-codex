--- Leaves a fading footprint on this floor. x/y are in token position space; angle is the direction the print faces in degrees counterclockwise from +x (default 90). image is an image asset id or a built-in image path such as 'footprints/boots.png', drawn toe-up (the top of the image points the way the creature walks); omit it for the generated boot print. length is the print's length in tiles (default 0.3) and width its width (default: follow the image's proportions); scale multiplies both (default 1). mirror flips it to the other foot; color tints it (default black at 40% opacity, a faint darkening of the ground); lifetime is the seconds it takes to fade away (default 60). Client-local: not saved or synced, so every client adds its own prints from the same token movement. Does nothing if the floor is not currently shown.

--- Draws (or erases) map geometry on this floor as one undoable building operation. Options: points (required: a list of paths, each an interleaved {x1, y1, x2, y2, ...} list in floor tiles), tileid (floor tilesheet; sets floor=true), wallid (wall asset; sets walls=true), wallheight (tiles, 0 = full), erase, eraseInvisibleOnly (erase only markup walls/solids), walls, floor, solid (filled block, see supportsSolidOperations), closed (default true), terrain (draw on the Ground layer), layer (TileLayer name, default Building), fade. Door state for an op drawn with an OPENABLE wall type (WallAsset.openable): doorOpen, doorLocked, doorSecret (all default false; a secret door is hidden from players in every state until the Director reveals it). Use SetDoorState to change door state afterwards.
--- @param options {points: number[][], tileid: nil|string, wallid: nil|string, wallheight: nil|number, erase: nil|boolean, eraseInvisibleOnly: nil|boolean, walls: nil|boolean, floor: nil|boolean, solid: nil|boolean, closed: nil|boolean, terrain: nil|boolean, layer: nil|string, fade: nil|number, doorOpen: nil|boolean, doorLocked: nil|boolean, doorSecret: nil|boolean}
function MapFloorLua:ExecutePolygonOperation(options) end

--- Finds the drawn wall geometry nearest to a point on this floor's building layer. Options: x, y (world coords), maxDistance (tiles, default 1), invisibleOnly (default false: when true only walls with invisible assets are considered), atMouse (default false: when true x/y are ignored, the current mouse position is used, and walls are matched in projected screen space -- each vertex projected by its surface-altitude parallax like wall rendering -- so the result is what is visually under the cursor even on steep slopes or raised/lowered ground). Returns nil, or a table with wallid, wallheight, distance, points (interleaved x,y list of the wall's full path, suitable for passing to ExecutePolygonOperation), segmentIndex (1-based index of the nearest edge within the path) and segment (interleaved x,y of that nearest edge's two endpoints, in floor space).
--- @param options {x: nil|number, y: nil|number, maxDistance: nil|number, invisibleOnly: nil|boolean, atMouse: nil|boolean}
--- @return nil|{wallid: string, wallheight: number, distance: number, points: number[], segmentIndex: number, segment: number[]}
function MapFloorLua:GetNearestWallSegment(options) end

--- Lists the door operations on this floor: every building operation drawn with an OPENABLE wall type (WallAsset.openable), i.e. the wall-native markup doors MarkupDoorController floats icons over. Each entry: layer (terrain layer key, e.g. 'Building'), opid, wallid, open, locked, secret (the op's doorOpen / doorLocked / doorSecret), closed, and paths (one interleaved {x1, y1, x2, y2, ...} floor-space list per drawn path, with a closed path's first point repeated at its end, so consecutive pairs are exactly the door's edges). Open doors are included even though they contribute no walls. Director tooling: every client holds the map data, so this is not a secrecy boundary.
--- @return {layer: string, opid: string, wallid: string, open: boolean, locked: boolean, secret: boolean, closed: boolean, paths: number[][]}[]
function MapFloorLua:GetDoorOperations() end

--- Sets the door state of one door operation on this floor (an op drawn with an OPENABLE wall type - see GetDoorOperations). Options: opid (required), layer (terrain layer key, default 'Building'), and any of open, locked, secret (each nil = leave unchanged; a secret door is hidden from players in every state until revealed with secret=false). Like the door icon, this clones the operation with a fresh timestamp and swaps it in under a NEW id (old id deleted) as one undoable command, which is what makes every client rebuild its walls; when open changes, the wall type's open/close sound plays for everyone unless silent=true. Returns the new opid, or nil if the op was not found or is not a door. Director tooling.
--- @param options {opid: string, layer: nil|string, open: nil|boolean, locked: nil|boolean, secret: nil|boolean, silent: nil|boolean}
--- @return nil|string
function MapFloorLua:SetDoorState(options) end

--- Changes the wall type of drawn markup wall geometry on this floor. Options: wallid (required, the new wall asset id) plus exactly one selection: segment = {ax, ay, bx, by} (floor-space endpoints of one drawn edge, e.g. GetNearestWallSegment's segment result - every operation with an edge coincident with it is retyped WHOLE, the click-a-wall gesture) or rect = {x1, y1, x2, y2} (floor-space axis-aligned rectangle - every operation edge intersecting it, boundary inclusive, is retyped at EDGE granularity). Only non-erase, non-solid wall operations whose current wall asset is invisible are considered (markup scope; art walls are never touched). In rect mode an operation with only some edges caught is split at its own vertices into a kept part and a retyped part - no polygon clipping is involved - and every replacement keeps the original operation's timestamp (so it re-applies in the same order relative to erases) under a new id, which is what makes clients rebuild. One undoable command per call. Returns the number of edges retyped. Probe inside pcall: older engine builds lack this method.
--- @param options {wallid: string, segment: nil|number[], rect: nil|number[]}
--- @return number
function MapFloorLua:RetypeWallEdges(options) end

--- Read-only companion to RetypeWallEdges' rect mode, for live previews: returns the drawn markup wall edges a rect-mode call with the same rectangle would retype, as a flat interleaved list {a1x, a1y, b1x, b1y, a2x, ...} of floor-space edge endpoints. Options: rect = {x1, y1, x2, y2} (required); wallid (optional - edges of operations already of this type are omitted, matching what a retype to that type would skip). Same eligibility as RetypeWallEdges: non-erase, non-solid wall operations with an invisible wall asset. Capped at 300 edges. Probe inside pcall: older engine builds lack this method.
--- @param options {rect: number[], wallid: nil|string}
--- @return number[]
function MapFloorLua:GetWallEdgesInRect(options) end

--- Break a wall segment, removing it from the map and optionally spawning a rubble object found by keyword.
--- @param segLocVal? any
--- @param segDirVal? any
--- @param rubbleKeywordVal? any
function MapFloorLua:BreakWallSegment(segLocVal, segDirVal, rubbleKeywordVal) end

--- Get the wall-voxel objects (ObjectComponentWallVoxel) stacked on the given tile, ordered bottom to top. Returns an array of object instances; empty if the tile has no wall voxels.
--- @param locVal? any
--- @return any
function MapFloorLua:GetWallVoxelsAt(locVal) end

--- Reconcile the wall-voxel column on the given tile with its solid building operation. Call after spawning wall-voxel objects locally (SpawnObjectLocal) and BEFORE uploading them: this assigns stack ordering to new voxels, snaps them to the tile center, and rewrites the column's map operation. Also safe to call any time to repair a desynced column.
--- @param locVal? any
function MapFloorLua:SyncWallVoxelColumn(locVal) end

--- Destroy the wall voxel occupying the given altitude (in tiles above floor zero) on the given tile. The column collapses by one cube. Returns true if a voxel was destroyed, false if the tile has no wall voxels.
--- @param locVal? any
--- @param altitudeVal? any
--- @return boolean
function MapFloorLua:DestroyWallVoxel(locVal, altitudeVal) end
