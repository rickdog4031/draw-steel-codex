--- Represents a discrete tile location on the map, including x, y coordinates, floor index, and altitude.
--- @class Loc
--- @field west Loc The location one tile to the west.
--- @field east Loc The location one tile to the east.
--- @field north Loc The location one tile to the north.
--- @field south Loc The location one tile to the south.
--- @field withCurrentFloor Loc A new Loc with the floor index set to the currently active floor.
--- @field isValidFloor boolean True if the floor index of this Loc corresponds to a valid, visible floor.
--- @field x number The x tile coordinate.
--- @field y number The y tile coordinate.
--- @field floor number The floor index.
--- @field altitude number The altitude value at this location.
--- @field xyfloorOnly Loc A new Loc with only x, y, and floor preserved, stripping tiny size and altitude.
--- @field xyOnly Loc A new Loc with only x and y preserved, stripping floor, tiny size, and altitude.
--- @field isOnMap boolean True if this location is a valid position on the current map.
--- @field withGroundAltitude Loc A new Loc with altitude set to the ground level at this position.
--- @field platformAltitude number|nil The deck altitude (in tiles) of a platform object -- a Floor object with the platform property, such as a bridge or walkway -- at this x,y position, or nil if there is no platform here. Independent of this Loc's own altitude; compare against it to tell whether a creature at this Loc is standing on the deck.
--- @field valid boolean True if this Loc has valid coordinates.
--- @field point2 Vector2 The x, y coordinates of this Loc as a Vector2.
--- @field point3 Vector3 The x, y coordinates and altitude of this Loc as a Vector3.
--- @field str string The encoded string representation of this Loc, suitable for serialization.
